# KadeChat Server
## What is Kade Chat?
KadeChat is like Discord but with open source servers, unlike discord & teamspeak.
This is no by anymeans trying to take over discord/teamspeak. This is just for small teams to communicate.
## How to use/install
First download and change the code for the server, then build it. Port forward 4000 on a linux/windows machine.
If your on linux install **Mono**. then do `mono <file-name>`, Then connect to it with Kade Chat.
## Can i support it?
Of course! If you want to make changes sumbit a pull request and I will look into it.
